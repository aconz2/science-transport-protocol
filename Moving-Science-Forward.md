# Moving Beyond Publishers
## A plan to push scientific communication into the 21st century

### Andrew Consroe – June 2015

## Abstract
Scientific journals are a surviving artifact of the last millennium and are
slowing down scientific progress. Even though journals also publish online (and
some are “Open Access”), the Internet provides far richer capabilities than
digitizing a sheet of paper and adding a few hyperlinks. Research should be
free to access and easily modifiable to lower the barrier to progress. Some
publishers have attempted to remedy these problems in response to market
demands, but researchers have their hands tied as they rely on publications to
advance their career. In addition, the vast number of publishers each
introducing their own business models creates an inconsistent and unproductive
environment for research. Industries with open standards best serve the
consumer, while publishers continue to best serve their bank accounts. Science
needs a common platform to enable modern and global research utilizing the
Internet for collaboration, corroboration, and distribution.

## Why do we have scientific journals?
STM: International Association of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers
cites five reasons why journals are an “integral part of scientific research
itself” (Ware and Mabe, 6). They are:

1. Disseminate information to intended audiences
2. Establish author's precedence
3. Maintain quality through peer review
4. Provide archival copies for reference and citation
5. Navigate large volumes of published material

These characteristics are not unique to a journal and can be provided by other
means. Doing so in an open and standardized way will propel science into a
modern age.

## What's wrong with journals?
### Transparency
Publishers seek to maintain quality in scientific publications through peer
review, a process designed to select significant and sound research. Submitted
papers are first reviewed by an editor who can elect to conduct peer review.
Reviews are typically conducted by two or three researchers in the same field
as the submitted paper and final discretion is left to the editor whether to
accept or reject it. This process varies between the thousands of journals:
single-blind, double-blind, pre-publication review, post-publication review,
open comments, closed comments, etc. This results in no standard procedure and
no clear insight into why a certain paper is accepted or rejected.

The lack of standards provides no guarantees to the quality of the review, yet
scientists believe this system is sound. However, editors have been conned into
selecting peer reviewers who are the authors themselves or their close friends
resulting in a total of 110 retractions between 2012-2014 (Ferguson et al.).
While no system is foolproof, readers are forced to put blind faith in the
system because it lacks the transparency necessary for public audit. Even when
peer review is not gamed, there is still is no reason to believe it selects for
significance and sound research. High impact-factor journals like Science are
known for publishing important scientific findings. But even a highly respected
journal like Science cannot verify the scientific integrity of the articles it
publishes. A recent high-profile paper regarding lasting opinion changes after
talking with gay or minority canvassers was retracted from Science after the
data used was found to be fabricated (LaCour et al.). This case highlights the
overconfidence placed in peer review and the potential impact on the malleable
public opinion. Science cannot be based on faith of a black-box system;
researchers need something a little more scientific.

### Access
Publishers charge readers to view articles, or in the case of newer Open Access
business models, they charge writers to publish articles. Placing the cost on
the reader or writer is detrimental to the dissemination of information.
Traditional subscriptions for universities can total extraordinary sums, with
Harvard's library paying $3.5m a year in 2012 (Sample). This drains money from
universities who face budget shortages and students who face increasing
tuition. In addition, personal subscriptions cost hundreds of dollars and
prevent those who are not associated with an institution from accessing
scientific literature. This group of people includes high school students and
members of the general public interested in science. Whether they are
conducting their own research or simply looking for a primary source of
information, readers should be free to access scientific literature regardless
of their economic status or affiliation.

Publishers have attempted to address this issue with variants of the Open
Access business model. “Business model” is emphasized here because publishers
are businesses at heart and their motives may not align with researchers' best
interests. Open Access comes in a variety of flavors but the general shift is
to source money from the writers and not the readers. While this does empower
the general public to access papers for free, the cost merely shifts to the
funding organizations. Grant funds are then funneled directly to the
publishers. In addition, independent researchers who cannot afford the thousand
dollars to publish an article are excluded from the scientific body. Publishers
make science a pay-to-play club, which is a great business model, but a poor
research model.

### Publish or Perish
Researchers rely on high profile publications to advance their career and
increase their chances of receiving grant funding. There is a surplus of
trained graduates who face limited research positions with a shortage of
funding. This creates a hyper-competitive market where researchers must focus
on projects which are appealing to grant readers and editors alike. These “sexy
stories” corner the market and preclude fundamental research which is an
unsustainable practice since a “sexy story” builds upon those fundamentals.
Removing publishers cannot directly affect grant readers, but it will remove
the journal's name from an evaluation. As previously discussed, a paper's
acceptance to a particular journal is an inconsistent process and so the
importance of journal name is largely a cultural construct.

## Why not change journals?
Journals are ultimately a business and their interests lie in making money, not
progressing science. Market demand will not suffice to influence necessary
changes because researchers are strangled by publish or perish. There are lots
of journals with new schemes that address the above issues; but they are
incompatible and layering fixes upon a bad system will only result in a tower
of mud. Scientific communication needs to be open and standardized, a result
which can only come from the drawing boards.

## Proposed System
### Overview
The core components of an open scientific communication system are as follows:

* Users – professional researchers, hobbyist scientists, students of all levels, the public
* Content – articles, reviews, grant funding, comments, data, source code, etc.
* Ledger – a consistent and verified append-only history of all communications

All content is produced by a user and can be linked to another piece of
content. The ledger records the events and associated data on the network
(added user A; user A wrote article B; user C edited article B; etc.) and will
be hosted by each university, for example. Ledgers will communicate with one
another to replicate information and verify the integrity of its contents.

### Process
1. Establish a core working group dedicated to daily work on the system
2. Hold a series of free meetings inviting the international research community to participate in gathering ideas and opinions
3. Finalize a specification and write an initial implementation
4. Solicit researchers to grow the users and content

### Accountability
A fundamental part of the system will be to establish the identity and
authenticity of a user. Researchers currently rely on publishers to verify the
identity (where do they work?) and authenticity (are they being impersonated?)
of authors. In place of publishers, computers provide these two properties with
even stronger guarantees. Any message produced by an identity can be signed and
then later verified to prevent fraud and data tampering. A network of people
can vouch for the identity of others which creates a web of trust. This would
allow, for example, researchers working at a university to all vouch that their
colleagues indeed work at the same university. 

### Transparency
All communications which happen in the system are public and permanent; edits
or deletions are recorded but the full changelog is persistent. This opens the
gates for new forms of participation:  reviewing reviews, incorporating
feedback, accrediting editors, etc. People can be held accountable for what
they said and when they said it, which is currently missing from peer review.
In addition, data analysis of the network could reveal personal bias and other
underlying problems which are currently imperceptible.

Maintaining a full record of changes to a research paper provides immense
power. Consider Figure 1, where paper B cites paper A, but some time later
paper A is revised. Paper B may now be citing outdated information and its
authors need to be alerted. This issue is magnified when, for example, paper A
is retracted in Figure 2. Much like before, paper B needs to be reevaluated but
paper C is also at risk for citing bad work. By explicitly tracking the
dependencies between papers, computers can help researchers address problems as
they arise. While this may be possible today, it will be easily automated in
the proposed system.

### Access
The communications network will require people or groups to maintain Internet
connected servers with the appropriate software. Universities and other
institutions are good candidates for this role as it is already standard to
maintain e-mail servers. With the money saved from exorbitant subscription
costs, there should be little objection to running these servers.
Decentralizing the network brings resilience to computer failure as well as
balancing network load. The general public can access the system through
personal servers, community servers, government servers, or even companies
which specializes in hosting.

Articles published on the network should be done under a permissive license to
ensure collaboration is the default. It will be necessary to provide authors a
suitable license of their choice as to not discourage publication, but
preference must be weighed with freedom. The freedoms to distribute and improve
upon will foster collaboration and can be seen in other industries. Software
companies thrive on developing programs in the open to be improved by others
because everyone benefits from the innovations it produces.

Data used in a research paper must be linked to and made available on the
network. Much like user identity verification, the integrity of datasets and
their changes need to be automatically tracked to promote good standards.

### Navigation
Journals are primarily categorized by their field of study and some may claim
that without them, researchers will be lost in the flood of articles. To
address these concerns, it will be necessary to provide a set of primitives –
ranking, search index, etc. – that will allow more sophisticated navigation of
the large amount of content. These capabilities should not be built in, lest
they will be unsuitable for the growing needs of researchers. Algorithms can be
developed as needed to provide more specific results or show only the more
reputable ones, for example. This allows researchers to decide for themselves,
if they wish, what is important to them. Editors currently fill this position
and do so with unknowable bias and constraints on time and space. There is no
stopping self-proclaimed or even professional editors from creating reading
lists, but researchers have autonomy in how they wish to explore the
literature.

## Further impact
A network of free scientific communication will not only improve upon current
systems, but also open the door to new possibilities. For example, researchers
play to the interests of editors who want to see big, sexy stories filled with
profound impact. This leaves all sorts of research out of the public eye, like
small improvements on existing methods and negative or null results.
Researchers can learn not only from others' success, but also from their
failures. A new system would not suffer the space constraints publishers face
today and would allow for new categories of knowledge to be shared. This may
even result in a dulling of the idea of publication, as science could be shared
on a daily basis and may be viewed as an open research notebook.

While publishers may be obsolete in their current form, there will be a new
industry surrounding this system: authors can choose to have their articles
formatted or edited by professionals; developers can create new programs to
increase productivity; and websites can provide curated collections of
articles. Large publishers who face loss of revenue will be forced to adapt to
the changing times, a healthy sign of growth. This should also bring power back
to the researchers as they will seek out a company based on the quality of
their product and not out of necessity.

Scientific research has faced limited funding recently and is only exacerbated
by inordinate publisher fees. Scientific journal publishers generated over $25b
in revenue worldwide in 2013, a figure nearly equal to the NIH budget (Ware and
Mabe, 6) (AAAS). Imagine the immediate benefit if that money were to stay in
the hands of researchers and not funneled into the pockets of publishers. Also,
by eliminating financial barriers to sharing research, science will develop a
new class of global researchers – anyone with an Internet connection – and
benefit from their creativity and innovation. The surge in hackerspaces, open
source software, maker fairs, and biohackerspaces are proof of the public's
curiosity and love of science. It's unfair to exclude this group from
participating in research and could accelerate the pace of discovery.

## Conclusion
We are soliciting a grant of $1m for a two year period to develop an open
standard of a protocol to support scientific research over the Internet and
provide an initial implementation for universities and other institutions to
begin using. Funding will go towards the full time salary of five team members
that is competitive with the programming industry. Community involvement in
the development process will ensure a protocol that is useful to the whole
scientific body, but will require significant time to manage these
communications. A two year period should allow ample time to incorporate
feedback before standardization. In addition, a system developed in the open
will increase the rate of adoption in the entrenched research community. While
the resistance to change may be great from some and even stronger from
publishers, the world faces problems which require solutions in the near
future. A system to support scientific research at a heightened pace and of
greater quality is necessary to meet these challenges.
